        <p id="care-intro">Rabbits are very house-friendly pets but as all other pets, they require specific caring directions. Caring for rabbits involves providing proper housing, a well-balanced diet, routine veterinary care, and attention to their social and mental well-being. You should regularly monitor your rabbit and make sure they are comfortable and have everything they need. These little creatures need prompt attention just like any other pet. Here are the ways you can make sure you are caring for your rabbit properly.</p>
        
        <h2 id="living-heading">Housing</h2>
        
        <p id="living-conditions">Rabbits are indoor pets. They are very social so they need daily interactions. Having them indoors will help with the social aspect of taking care of a rabbit. If your rabbit is living outdoors, they are in danger of possible predators. They can also contract diseases, face harsh temperatures, and also because they need interaction, your pet will be lonely. </p>
        
        <h2 id="cage-heading">Cage/Bed</h2>
        
        <div id="cage">
        <p>Your cage for the rabbit should be spacious because they need a lot of room for at least 4 hops. Solid flooring is suggested to avoid irritating their feet. The cages should be cleaned weekly and rabbits should have an exercise area.</p>
        
        <p>Cages should include toys (both playable and chewable), a place for drinking water, a food dish, and litter pan. </p>
        </div>
        
        <h2 id="diet-heading">Diet</h2>
        
        <p id="diet-info">Rabbits are herbivores. Their regular diet consists of hay, green foods, pellets, treats, fresh water, and vitamins (if needed). Rabbits often eat their droppings for nutrition benefits so do not be alarmed when they do.</p>
        
        <h2 id="medical-heading">Medical</h2>
        
        <p id="medical-needs">Like all pets, Rabbits need to go in for regular veterinary appointments. They need extra care because they are prone to catching illnesses and getting sick. Rabbits are recommended to get neutered to prevent urinal cancer and aggressive behavior. They usually will not fall ill if kept in a clean environment and fed a well-balanced diet. If your rabbit habits seem to have changed, go see a veterinarian as soon as possible.  </p>
        
        <h2 id="grooming-heading">Grooming</h2>
        
        <p id="grooming-info">Rabbits, depending on the breed, require brushing, whether daily or once a week, this is needed. This reduces hairballs which can cause other medical conditions. The rabbits' nails should also be trimmed once a month. Cat nail trimmers will work but, be careful not to cut too far.</p>
